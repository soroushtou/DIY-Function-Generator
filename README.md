# DIY-Function-Generator
This is a DIY Function Generator that operates between 1Hz - 20MHz and the signal is generated by a rasbperry pi pico.

I designed a PCB with EasyEDA software and printed it on a copper board that later I etched it wit FeCl3 Acid.

It has multiple waveforms: Sine, Pulse, SinC, Gaussian and Noise.
I used MJE350 and KSE340 for the amplifier, and the upper bandwith is limited to 3Mhz.

I added a 1k potentiometer with two 220ohm resistors for offset. The middle pin of the potentiometer is connected after the capactitor on the op-amp outpu. It works well with lower frequencies and you can make a PWM wave.

Please note that at mid to high frequency levels, if you use a low impedence load, the signal amplitude drops. Here I added a 22ohm load:
